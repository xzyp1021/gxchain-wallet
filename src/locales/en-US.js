In just four years, GXChain has not only gained recognition from the top capitals as well as the market but also gained strong support from dozens of enterprises, including UnionPay, to reach a cooperative relationship.',
            stage2: 'In the past four years, the blockchain industry has undergone radical changes, and GXChain has never stopped moving forward. The revolutionary changes of DeFi in 2020 brought unprecedented changes to the blockchain industry, with the number of locked positions, the users, and on-chain accounts in decentralized finance increasing exponentially.In August 2020, we decided to embrace the change of DeFi, and start again with a collaborative mindset. And now, one year later, we have finally reached a historic moment on the road to change, and we will once again embark on a new journey in the crypto universe.'

                change_name: 'Why do we name REI Network?',
                stage1: 'It is known that the architectural design and roadmap of GXChain 2.0 have been in the actual development process since August 2020. The development of GXChain 2.0 is progressing well, with the GXChain 2.0 test network has launched on 14 July 2021, running smoothly and having undergone various tests.The slashing module was introduced in August and the free economic model was technically completed in October, which means that GXChain 2.0 is getting closer and closer to us. According to the current development schedule, the mainnet of GXChain 2.0 is expected to go live in December.',
                stage2: 'By then, GXChain 2.0 will be completely upgraded and refactored at the technical level and at the code level, becoming a brand new blockchain and an EVM-compatible Ethereum parallel chain, which is the biggest update and iteration after four years since GXChain first mainnet was published on June 15, 2017.As such, GXChain 2.0 is not only a new technical upgrade and iteration but also a new leap in positioning. We are pleased to see that GXChain 2.0 will be given a new historical mission, so we believe that the name of GXChain needs a more profound new naming to accommodate the team and the rapid development in future planning, so the team has decided to GXChain 2.0 be given a new name - REI Network - before the mainnet launched.',
                rei_mean: 'The meaning and origin of REI',
                stage3: 'REI is derived from the first three initials of the words Rapid, Economical, and Innovative, which correspond to the three important features of the REI Network. It also stands for free and economical, which fits in perfectly with the fundamental features of GXChain 2.0.',
                stage4: 'REI is a name that has been selected by the team with a strong sense of mission, it is the embodiment of GXC`s historical beginnings with a new vision for the future. Nor is the name change an end in itself, but rather a desire to face the unknown challenges. It represents our determination to change thoroughly, and REI will move forward again with our aspirations.'

                stage2: 'The GXChain 2.0 main network is a new system that will be compatible with Ethereum and will be more friendly to supporting enterprises and developers, lightweight, and quasi-free new application-level public chain. Through the optimization of the underlying code and the 4-year exploration of the public chain model and user building of its predecessor GXChain, the new public chain is built to meet the actual needs of the current blockchain and public chain segment development.',
                stage3: 'The new public chain GXChain 2.0  is likely to grow beyond the expected scale of the future ecosystem, and the demand for and use of coins will increase significantly. For this reason, the new public chain needs more fresh blood to ensure the development and promotion of GXChain 2.0. REI Network has a good solution for the current industry hotspots and for DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, and other sectors, and will become the hotspot and focus of the next industry competition to a certain extent. To make sure that REI network can better seize the opportunities in the foreseeable blockchain industry ecosystem in the future, the GXChain Foundation will implement the following plans -',

                upgrade: 'The team took out all the unlocked 25 million pieces as the ecosystem funds, of which 5 million were used for node rewards, 5 million for marketing, and 15 million for incentivizing developers and the ecosystem.',

The new governance function support will be different from the existing model of voting by the board of directors and node members but will become a "direct democracy" model where every coin holder can vote. Changes to the REI Network or suggestions from the community can be publicized in the community through proposals, and users can vote on REI to achieve the goal of "everyone can govern the REI Network", which is to increase the governance value of REI.

We can foresee that in the near future, more crypto users will start to convert to the on-chain users, who will trade, collect, entertain and even live on-chain, which is an irreversible trend brought about by the development of blockchain.',
                    stage2: 'his is our ultimate goal in splitting GXC, after which we will continue to strengthen the on-chain ecosystem and find our own method in the surging blockchain industry. REI Network is a new type of public chain that meets the actual needs of the current blockchain and public chain`s development through the optimization of the underlying code and the 4-year exploration of the public chain model and user building of its predecessor GXChain. In the past 4 years, our original goal has never changed. The scars we have had are the medals of fearlessness that we keep moving forward.',
                    stage3: 'At the same time, REI Network will be an international public chain with users in mind! We will focus on improving the performance of the public chain, and will also dedicate more to user experience optimization. The 5 million GXC allocated for marketing will be partly spent by the team, which includes not only marketing but also, more importantly, giving back to the community, and rewarding users and the contributors from our community.',

In which anyone will be allowed to initiate proposals to the community through the governance function. I believe that in the foreseeable future, more people will stand together with REI Network to share the right of governance!'

The main feature is to strengthen the tech features of lightweight and free, while being infinitely extensible, so as to develop lightweight and self-contained innovative public chains, dedicated to solving the collective dilemma faced by the current public chains, and providing a self-contained solution for the transformation of public chains and a new paradigm of cross-chain.',
                    stage2: 'When building a new blockchain, the initial users are actually the developers, who need to use their creativity to attract users (including the top applications, innovative use cases, and experiences, etc.). But the choice between the various platforms is a key question for developers to consider from the outset. The EVM ecosystem could be seen as a mobile operating system created by ETH and is the most technically mature and stable mobile system available, which is certainly the most attractive to existing developers who can develop on any EVM-compatible blockchain platform without any learning costs.',
                    stage3: 'The upgrade to EVM compatibility means that REI Network can seamlessly migrate almost all DeFi DApps with higher performance and lower cost of use, thus creating the conditions for lower cost Defi innovation and cross-chain migration. By enabling the rapid expansion of its application landscape in a short period of time, users within the ecosystem will have a wider choice of applications and development tools, and as development becomes less difficult, the incentive component of the ecosystem will become more attractive to the average developer, creating the perfect loop for a virtuous cycle.',
                    stage4: 'Secondly, EVM compatibility means that as the number of users on the chain grows and the DeFi universe continues to expand, the emerging public chain ecosystem has the opportunity to take over the overflow from ETH due to performance limitations. Thanks to the ease of EVM, new public chains will also have the opportunity to gain access to the top existing DeFi projects and the users who use them.'
